Yooo! This is a test case for NoteMD! This is how it works:

Plaintext can be viewed written normally, like this!

Here comes the first four bars:
| C4-q  C4-q  G4-q  q | A4-q  A4-q  G4-h |
| F4-q  F4-q  E4-q  E4-q | D4-q  D4-q  C4-h |

If the time signature is not specified the bar will fit as many notes as you want!
In this next case we spesify the time signature, key and expressions:

| { 4/4 } { cmajorÂ } G4-q  G4-q  F4-q  F4-q | E4-q  E4-q (f) D4-h |
